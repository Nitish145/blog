The first Week focussed on adding enhancements for the `mobile_app`.. The first one being adding localizations to the app. Just an overview, the localizations logic lives in `lib/locale/locales.dart` and generated `arb` and messages in `lib/l10n/`

`AppLocalizations` are handled the `InheritedWidget` way, hence have an `of` method which returns `Localizations.of<AppLocalizations>(context, AppLocalizations)`. flutter's `Localization` defines the `Locale` for its child and the localized resources that the child depends on. Localized resources are loaded by the `AppLocalizationDelegate` which is just a collection of localized resources. The most important of the methods of the delegate being the `load` method, which is responsible for returning localized messages.

```dart
class AppLocalizations {
  static Future<AppLocalizations> load(Locale locale) {
    final name =
        locale.countryCode.isEmpty ? locale.languageCode : locale.toString();

    final localeName = Intl.canonicalizedLocale(name);

    return initializeMessages(localeName).then((bool _) {
      Intl.defaultLocale = localeName;
      return AppLocalizations();
    });
  }

  static AppLocalizations of(BuildContext context) {
    return Localizations.of<AppLocalizations>(context, AppLocalizations);
  }

  String get title {
    return Intl.message(
      'CircuitVerse',
      name: 'title',
      desc: 'Title for CircuitVerse Mobile',
    );
  }
}

class AppLocalizationsDelegate extends LocalizationsDelegate<AppLocalizations> {
  const AppLocalizationsDelegate();

  @override
  bool isSupported(Locale locale) => ['en'].contains(locale.languageCode);

  @override
  Future<AppLocalizations> load(Locale locale) => AppLocalizations.load(locale);

  @override
  bool shouldReload(AppLocalizationsDelegate old) => false;
}

```

```bash
# generate arb resources for the getters defined AppLocalizations
flutter pub pub run intl_translation:extract_to_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n lib/locale/locales.dart

# generate bunch of dart files that contains switching logic thru the above generated arb files
flutter pub pub run intl_translation:generate_from_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n --no-use-deferred-loading lib/l10n/intl_en.arb lib/l10n/intl_messages.arb lib/locale/locales.dart
```

The localizations delegates are registered in the `MaterialApp's localizationsDelegates`.

```dart
return MaterialApp(
  ...
  localizationsDelegates: [
    AppLocalizationsDelegate(),
    GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
    // For RTL Support
    GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
  ],
  supportedLocales: [
    Locale('en', ''),
  ],
  ...
)
```

And there we go, `AppLocalizations.of(context).title` gives you the localized title in `onGenerateTitle`.

The next thing was adding [pedantic](https://pub.dev/packages/pedantic) as `analysis_options.yaml` for improved code quality, and `Dart` static analysis.

The one thing i am proud of using this package is not that it is used in Google internally but having a better understanding of the `new`, `const` & `final` variables. The gist of which is the following :

- `const` is better than `final` as `*const* EdgeInsets.all(8)` doesn't clutter up the memory and these small things add up, you must agree..

- Most of the dart constructors are `const`, now you know why..

The second Week focussed on perfecting the `API` and adding some enhancements.. Some of the notable one's being adding `send_reset_password_instructions` & GET `public_key.pem` to decode the data encoded in the `token`.

```ruby
# POST api/v1/password/forgot
def forgot_password
  @user = User.find_by!(email: params[:email])
  # Devise is amazing :P
  @user.send_reset_password_instructions
  render json: { message: "password reset instructions sent to #{@user.email}" }
end

# GET /public_key.pem
def public_key
  public_key = File.open(Rails.root.join("config", "public.pem"), "r:UTF-8")
  send_file public_key
end
```

For the **Group's API** [#1462](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/1462) added `conter_cache` to cache `group_member_count` in `Groups` to avoid `N+1` queries.

First things first, `counter_cache: true` in `group_member.rb`.

```ruby
class GroupMember < ApplicationRecord
  ...
  belongs_to :group, counter_cache: true
end
```

Add a column in `groups_table` that would works as a counter for number of group_members.

```ruby
def change
  add_column :groups, :group_members_count, :integer
end
```

Resetting counters for already existing records.

```ruby
def change
  Group.all.each do |group|
    Group.reset_counters(group.id, :group_members)
  end
end
```

Now, `group.group_members.count -> group.group_members.size`, this is not much change, but hey check the logs, you'll realize :P

> Just another optimization, thanks [@tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons/)

```ruby
# BEFORE -> O(N)
project = assignment.projects.find { |p| p.author_id == params[:current_user].id }

# AFTER -> O(1)
project = assignment.projects.find_by(author_id: params[:current_user].id)
```

[#1473](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/1473), [#1477](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/1477), [#1482](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/1482) were merged with some minor tweaks.. Yay!! The API docs would now live in [CircuitVerse](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse) itself, updated the docs in view of the final API, for more details refer [#1512](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/1582).

This wraps it up for the first evaluation `:fingers_crossed:`

> See Ya Next Week
